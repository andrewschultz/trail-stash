A blob rind lies here! You may be able to figure out what it's doing, or it might do, so you'll know whether or not you want to [[inspect it|Rob Blind]].

:: Bay Hut

What treasures await you in the bay hut? You can only dream! You worry there might be so much, you won't be able to carry it, and you'll regret whatever you didn't take, even if you have enough. You walk in with eyes closed and open them ... nothing, at first. Did you follow [[wrong leads]]?

:: Wrong Leads

Wait. No. There is a book here. It's called <i>Bold Goals</i>. Wow! It's really good. The goals aren't just about crushing people or making money, but doing things you always meant to, and hoping people can do the same. Stuff like that is more valuable than treasure, and all those cliches. And really, what else could there be than bold goals in life?

It's so good, you decide to read it again. But the pages are blank. Perhaps if you read them too often, your dreams and goals and actions would get too mechanical. Perhaps the book has some weird magic that gets drained each time someone reads it, so it has to save its magic for the next person.

Whichever. You're eager to go improve lives, and stuff. You kick a gold bowl out of the way as you exit the Bay Hut to a new life. But then you realize it couldn't hurt to start with a little capital, so you take the gold bowl with.

:: Rob Blind

Oh, no! The blob rind swells up to several times its original side in order to, uh, rob you blind. It only enveloped your belongings, not you, but you're so embarrassed by the experience, you give up. Or, you know, you can undo.
